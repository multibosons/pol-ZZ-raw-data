 DESCRIPTION
 -----------
 
 This repository contains the numerical results in Yoda format used for the COMETA project for doubly polarised ZZ production at the LHC@13TeV in the 4-lepton decay channel:
 
      p p -> Z (e+ e-) Z (mu+ mu-) + X
 
 For the setup, details of the calculations, and phenomenological results we refer to Ref. [1].
 For additional details on various calculations please refer to Refs. [2-19].

 The repository is organised as follows:
 
 FO/: fixed-order results
   |
   |__> LO/:      LO (qqbar, tree-level)
   |__> NLOEW/:   LO (qqbar, tree-level) + NLO electroweak correction (qqbar, photon-q, photon-qbar)
   |__> NLOQCD/:  LO (qqbar, tree-level) + NLO QCD correction (qqbar, gq, gqbar)
   |__> NNLOQCD/: LO (qqbar, tree-level) + NLO QCD correction (qqbar, gq, gqbar) + NNLO QCD correction (qqbar, gq, gqbar, gg), excluding LO gg (loop-induced)
   |__> GG/:      LO (gg, loop-induced)
 
 PS/: parton-shower (PS) matched and merged results
   | 
   |__> GGmatched/: LO (gg, loop-induced) matched to parton shower
   |__> GGmerged/: LO (gg, loop-induced) merged (+ 0,1 jets) with parton shower
   |__> LOmatched/: LO (qq, tree-level) matched to parton shower
   |__> LOmerged/: LO (qq, tree-level) merged (+ 0,1,2 jets at LO) with parton shower
   |__> NLOQCDmatched/: NLO QCD (excludes LO gg loop-induced) matched to parton shower
   |__> NLOQCDmerged/: NLO QCD (excludes LO gg loop-induced) merged (+ 0,1 jets at NLO, + 2,3 jets at LO) with parton shower

 The parton-shower effects (via matching or merging) can come:
      > pure QCD PS (dubbed "qcd")
      > full event simulation, including QCD PS, QED PS, hadronisation and MPIs (dubbed "had")


 In each subfolder, predictions from different MC codes/generators are present in Yoda format for various unpolarised/polarised signals.
 The Yoda files are dubbed "<MC-code short name>_<accuracy>_<polarisation state>.yoda".
 The <polarisation state> takes the following names:
 
      ll (doubly longitudinal)
      lt (longitudinal - transverse)
      tl (transverse - longitudinal)
      tt (transverse - transverse)
      uu (unpolarised)
      ff (full off-shell)
 
 For polarised (ll, lt, tl, tt) and unpolarised (uu) states, double-Z-resonant diagrams are selected and treated in an on-shell approximation (DPA, NWA) or by simple diagram removal and kinematic cuts (BW).
 For the full off-shell case (ff), all diagrams at a given perturbative order [p p -> e+ e- mu+ mu- + X] are included, including non-resonant effects and complete spin correlations.
 For mixed states (lt, tl), the first letter refers to the Z boson decaying to e+ e-, the second one to the Z boson decaying to mu+ mu-.
  
 Remark #1: for POWHEG results LHE-level (dubbed "lhe") results at LO/NLOQCD are provided as well (including the hardest real QCD radiation generated according to the POWHEG Sudakov form factor).
 Remark #2: for NLOQCD Sherpa results, the NLO accuracy is exact for the full off-shell (ff) and unpolarised signals (uu), while it is approximate (nLOQCD) for polarised states (ll, lt, tl, tt).
